General\\/Card Issuance<\\/b>\\n\\n    On acceptance of the card application, Corn\\u00e8r Bank Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as the \\u201cBank\\u201d or \\u201cCorn\\u00e8rcard\\u201d) will issue to the applicant (hereinafter referred to as the \\u201cCardholder\\u201d), in cooperation with Dukascopy Bank SA (hereinafter referred to as \\u201cDukascopy\\u201d), a Swiss banking institution with registered offices in Geneva (hereinafter referred to as \\u201cDukascopy\\u201d), a physical or virtual prepaid, reloadable, personal, and nontransferable Corn\\u00e8rcard (hereinafter referred to as the \\u201cCard\\u201d). The Card will remain the property of the Bank and will be issued against payment of a monthly fee set by Dukascopy. The Cardholder acknowledges that any indicated shipping time is an estimate only that does not provide any guarantee with regard to a specific and precise service time. The Bank does neither guarantee an exact delivery date nor accept responsibility for shipments getting lost or damages incurred in transit, unless in case of gross negligence or willful intent. The Cardholder shall bear full responsibility for providing correct address data and organizing himself to pick up the card upon delivery through courier or at a local post office. The Cardholder shall keep the Card and the Card details in a safe place and protect it against unauthorized access. The Cardholder shall inform Dukascopy or the Bank immediately in writing of any changes to the information provided on the Card application form, including, in particular, any changes in personal data or change of address. The Cardholder will be liable in respect of the payment of the subscription fee and in respect of any and all obligations that may arise through use of the Card and under these General Terms and Conditions. The Cardholder acknowledges and accepts that Dukascopy shall act as representative of the Cardholder in the relationship of the latter with Corn\\u00e8rcard. Accordingly, he accepts that Dukascopy will have access to his personal data, to his transaction data and to any information that Corn\\u00e8rcard will provide to the Cardholder, via Dukascopy, in the course of its contractual relationship with Corn\\u00e8rcard. The Cardholder therefore accepts that Corn\\u00e8rcard and Dukascopy will share such personal data of the Cardholder in the course of the execution of his business relationship with Corn\\u00e8rcard.\\n\\n    <b>2. Validity of the Card\\/Spending Limit\\/Reloading the Card<\\/b>\\n\\n    The Card will remain valid until the date embossed upon it. The Bank reserves the right not to renew the Card and will be under no obligation to provide any reasons. The Cardholder shall sign the Card as soon as it is received. If the Card is renewed, the balance of the old Card will be transferred to the new Card, after deduction of the subscription fee. The Card can be used with an initial spending limit that corresponds to the amount transferred by the Cardholder, after deduction of the monthly subscription fee. The spending limit will decrease as Card usage increases and will rise when any subsequent reloading are made. The Cardholder acknowledges and accepts that the Card may be loaded exclusively via the bank account opened by the Cardholder with Dukascopy. Spending in excess of the limit set is not permitted. In the event that the limit is exceeded nevertheless, the Cardholder shall repay the excess amount immediately and in full.\\n\\n    <b>3. Use of the Card<\\/b>\\n\\n    The Cardholder will be entitled to purchase goods and services from affiliated merchants and to withdraw cash advances at authorized banks worldwide. The Cardholder may use the Card and his personal PIN to make cash withdrawals from automated teller machines (ATMs) and at authorized affiliated merchants. The Cardholder shall, as soon as possible, replace the PIN received from the Bank with a new PIN of his choice at any of the numerous ATMs in Switzerland displaying the card scheme\\/Visa or Mastercard logo. The Cardholder shall not write the PIN down or disclose the PIN to anyone else, not even to persons claiming to work for the Bank (including Corn\\u00e8rcard) or Dukascopy or identifying themselves as such. The Cardholder will be liable for any and all consequences that may arise from failure to comply with the obligation to safeguard the PIN and\\/or the Card. Authorized affiliated merchants and banks will be entitled to require proof of identity. By signing the appropriate voucher when using the Card or by using the PIN, the Cardholder agrees that the amount concerned is correct. Moreover, the Cardholder accepts the transaction amounts of any transactions carried out using the Card or the Card details but without any signature or without using the PIN (e.g. online). The Cardholder irrevocably authorizes the Bank to pay the transaction amount to the affiliated merchant or authorized bank. The Bank shall charge any amounts paid as a result of such transactions to the Cardholder\\u2019s Card. The Cardholder will be liable to the Bank in respect of any amounts paid by the Bank. The Bank reserves the right not to honor any vouchers that do not comply with these General Terms and Conditions. The Card merely functions as a cashless means of payment. The Bank will not be responsible or liable for any transactions carried out using the Card. In particular, the Cardholder acknowledges and agrees that the Bank will not be liable even if, for any reason, the affiliated merchants or authorized banks do not accept the Card, or accept it only in part. The Cardholder further acknowledges that the Bank will not be liable for the services provided by same and shall refrain from making any complaint to the Bank in connection with the vouchers themselves and\\/or the transactions relating thereto. This also applies in the case of late delivery of, or failure to deliver, goods or services. In the event of disputes or complaints of any kind concerning goods or services, or the exercise of any right accruing therefrom, the Cardholder shall approach the affiliated merchant and\\/or the authorized bank only. In particular, in the event of any dispute, the Cardholder will not be released from his obligation to pay the Bank the amounts shown on the monthly statement. The Card may only be used for transactions that are lawful.\\n\\n    <b>4. Processing of Transactions\\/Verification of the Balance<\\/b>\\n\\n    All purchases and other transactions made using the Card or the Card details, as well as all deposits, will be recognized on a value date basis according to the date of the accounting entry. The Cardholder shall accept the exchange rate used by the Bank for any expenditure or top-ups in currencies other than the Card currency. The Cardholder may at any time view the balance on his Card by means of the complimentary Online access functionalities available on the website of Dukascopy (www.dukascopy.bank). Alternatively, the Cardholder may check his balance by calling the Dukascopy\\u2019s Help Line 24h (+41 227 994 859). The balance includes all transactions notified to the Bank up to the evening of the previous working day. Any objections or complaints must be notified to the Bank immediately in writing but at any rate no later than 30 days following the date of the accounting entry. Late notifications will not be considered.\\n\\n    <b>5. Charges, Interest Rates, and Fees\\/Balance Refunds<\\/b>\\n\\n    The Cardholder may be required to pay charges, interest, and fees in connection with the use and administration of the Card. Information on charges, interest rates, and fees may be accessed at any time by visiting Dukascopy website (https:\\/\\/www.dukascopy.bank\\/swiss\\/fees-limits\\/) or by calling Dukascopy\\u2019s Help Line (+41 227 994 859). Any third-party charges and any costs incurred by the Cardholder will also be chargeable to the Cardholder. Dukascopy may adjust the charges, interest rates, and fees at any time at its discretion, for example due to changes in cost ratios or market conditions. Any such adjustments will be notified to the Cardholder in appropriate form. In the event that the Cardholder objects to any adjustments notified to him, he will be entitled to cancel the Card or applicable service immediately. If the Cardholder intends to stop using the Card, the Cardholder may, by way of exception, request a refund of any residual balance after deduction of an administration fee.\\n\\n    <b>6. Validity and Card blocking\\/cancellation\\/loss of the Card<\\/b>\\n\\n    The Cardholder shall sign the (physical) Card as soon as it is received. The Card will remain valid until the date embossed upon it. The physical card will be automatically renewed unless it is canceled in writing before it is due to expire. The Cardholder and Corn\\u00e8rcard may cancel the Card contract at any time with immediate effect without providing any reasons. Upon cancellation, all outstanding amounts owed will automatically become due and payable. The Cardholder is not entitled to a pro-rata refund or reimbursement of the monthly subscription fee. The Cardholder shall also reimburse any charges incurred after cancellation. If the Card is lost or stolen, the Cardholder must report the event immediately to Corn\\u00e8rcard or Dukascopy by telephone, with subsequent confirmation in writing. If the Card has been stolen, the Cardholder must also report the theft to the police. The Cardholder will be liable for any Card fraud or misuse of the Card until such time as Corn\\u00e8rcard receives notification of the loss or theft of the Card. The Cardholder will be exempted from liability provided that he has fulfilled his obligations of due diligence. Corn\\u00e8rcard reserves the right to block and\\/or recall the Card held by the Cardholder at any time, without prior notice and without having to provide reasons. Any decision to block or recall the Card will be final and incontestable. Corn\\u00e8rcard accepts no liability whatsoever for any consequences that may arise for the Cardholder as a result of blocking and\\/or recalling the Card. It is unlawful to use a blocked Card. Legal action may be taken in respect of any such use and in respect of any obligations incurred by the Cardholder as a result. Corn\\u00e8rcard reserves the right to provide the authorized affiliated merchants and banks with any information they may require for the purpose of recovering any amount owed directly from the Cardholder.\\n    \\n    <b>7. Data processing\\/appointment of third parties\\/further provisions<\\/b>\\n\\n    Corn\\u00e8rcard and Dukascopy are entitled, in their contacts with the Cardholder, to record telephone conversations between them and the Cardholder on quality assurance and security grounds, to store such recordings on data carriers, and to retain these for a period of one year. The Cardholder confirms that the information provided on the Card application form is true and correct and authorizes the Bank to obtain from public bodies (debt enforcement authorities, residents\\u2019 registration offices, guardianship authorities), his employer, banks, and the Zentralstelle f\\u00fcr Kreditinformation (ZEK) (Central Office for Credit Information) any information that may be required for the purpose of assessing his application (regarding current address, financial standing, any guardianship arrangement). Whenever the Card is used, the Bank will only receive the information it requires to issue the monthly statement to the Cardholder. The Cardholder acknowledges and agrees that more detailed statements are issued in line with global standards for four groups of products and services: purchases of fuel, purchases of flight tickets, hotel bills, and bills for the hire of motor vehicles. Corn\\u00e8rcard may notify the Zentralstelle f\\u00fcr Kreditinformation (ZEK) (Central Office for Credit Information) if the Card is blocked due to payment arrears or Card misuse. The ZEK may disclose such information to other ZEK members (companies operating in the consumer credit, leasing, or credit card sectors \\u2013 a list of members is available on zek.ch) in the event that such information is required for the purposes of entering into or performing an agreement with the Cardholder. The Cardholder accepts that even with respect to transactions conducted in Switzerland, data will be forwarded to Corn\\u00e8rcard via the international credit card network.\\n\\n    Corn\\u00e8rcard is entitled to commission third parties in Switzerland or abroad to perform all or part of the services pertaining to the contractual relationship, including reward and loyalty programs (e.g. application reviews, Card manufacture and personalization, contract management including printing and dispatch of correspondence together with monthly statements, execution of reloads,  online services, payment collections, client communications, credit risk calculations, payment processing, IT) and for the improvement of the risk models used in fraud prevention. The Cardholder authorizes the Bank to provide these third parties with the data necessary for the diligent performance of the tasks assigned to them and, if required, to transmit this data abroad for this purpose. Data is only disclosed if the recipients undertake to keep the data confidential and to maintain an appropriate level of data protection and to ensure that any other contracting partners are also bound by this obligation. The Cardholder acknowledges that data that is transferred abroad may not be subject to data protection or to an equivalent level of data protection to that under Swiss law. Personal data are maintained in electronic and\\/or paper format. Monthly statements and all other items of Corn\\u00e8rcard correspondence are printed, packed, and prepared for dispatch by partner companies located in Switzerland that have been entrusted by Corn\\u00e8r Banca SA with the provision of such services in Switzerland. Accordingly, the Bank or third parties appointed by the Bank may store, process, and use Cardholder and transaction data, in particular for the purposes of marketing, market research, and creating customer profiles. The storage, processing, and use of Cardholder data will allow personalized advice, customized offers, and information on the Bank\\u2019s products and services to be supplied to the Cardholder. The following data may be processed in particular: information on the Cardholder, Card transactions, and any additional or ancillary services. The Bank may offer to assign or assign all or any of the rights accruing to it under this contract (use of the Card, subscription fee, etc.) to third parties both within Switzerland and abroad. It will be authorized to disclose information and data in connection with this contract to such third parties at any time. If such third parties are not subject to Swiss bank-client confidentiality, such information will be disclosed only if the recipients undertake to keep the information and data confidential and to ensure that any other contracting partners are also bound by this obligation (as a general rule, information and data will only be disclosed to third parties for debt recovery and enforcement purposes).\\n\\n    The Cardholder also confirms that he has read and understood the terms set out in these General Terms and Conditions and the schedule of \\u201cCharges, Interest Rates, and Fees\\u201d and by signing the Card application form agrees to all the applicable terms. The Cardholder will receive a copy of these General Terms and Conditions in the course of the application process. By signing and\\/or using the Card, the Cardholder confirms that he agrees to keep within the spending limit set for the Cardholder by Corn\\u00e8rcard. Signing and\\/or using the Card also constitute\\/constitutes further confirmation of acceptance of the General Terms and Conditions. Further information on the data protection policy and our rights under the Data Protection Act can be found at cornercard.ch\\/dataprotection.\\n\\n    <b>8. Insurance brokerage<\\/b>\\n\\n    The holder of a credit or prepaid card (hereinafter \\u201cCardholder\\u201d) acknowledges that, when contracts of insurance are brokered, the Insurer shall be solely liable for any errors, negligence or inaccurate information. Personal data made available in connection with such insurance may be forwarded to the Insurer and are administered by the Bank and the Insurers exclusively for the purpose of performing and administering the contract of insurance or of processing a claim. Personal data may be transmitted to designated third parties and\\/or other member companies of the Bank for the purpose of processing the contract of insurance. Data may also be transferred abroad provided the country offers equivalent data protection (as compared to Swiss data protection legislation).\\n\\n    <b>9. Compliance with Statutory Requirements\\/Exchange of Information<\\/b>\\n\\n    The Cardholder acknowledges and agrees that for the purposes of his business relationship with the Bank, he will be solely responsible for complying with all statutory and regulatory requirements, including but not limited to any requirements pertaining to tax, which may apply to him pursuant to the law of the jurisdiction in which he is resident or domiciled, or in general, pursuant to the laws of all jurisdictions in which he is required to pay tax in respect of any credit balance available on the Card. The Bank will have no liability whatsoever in respect of such compliance. The Cardholder shall consult an expert adviser if he is in any doubt as to his compliance with these requirements. The Cardholder is aware that the Bank may be required under agreements between Switzerland and other countries and as a result of individual or group requests pursuant to such agreements, or on the basis of internationally recognized standards, for example standards applying to the automatic exchange of information, to disclose information regarding payment cards to the relevant Swiss or foreign tax authorities.\\n\\n    <b>10. Amendments to the General Terms and Conditions\\/Place of Jurisdiction and Applicable Law<\\/b>\\n\\n    The Bank reserves the right to amend these General Terms and Conditions at any time. The Cardholder will be informed of any such amendments by circular letter or in some other appropriate form. The amendments will be deemed to have been accepted unless the Cardholder raises an objection within 30 days of notification. All legal relations between the Cardholder and the Bank will be governed by and construed in accordance with substantive Swiss law. Lugano (Switzerland) will be the place of performance, the place of debt enforcement for Cardholders residing abroad, and the exclusive place of jurisdiction for all disputes, subject to mandatory provisions of Swiss law. The Bank will, however, also have the right to take legal action against the Cardholder in the competent court of his place of residence or in any other competent court.\\n\\n    08\\/2021
